# The Ability of Understanding How Animals Think

Did you know? **Turtles, water snakes, crocodiles, alligators, dolphins, whales, and other water going creatures will drown if kept underwater too long.**

## As you can already notice, this question has always been tricky and worried many philosophers, scientists, researches, and ordinary people. This relates not only to creatures, but also to human beings. What does science say about this? What evidence we’ve got?

### Are we able to look into the mysterious, peculiar pet’s world? 

The investigation of this subject had led to various findings that greatly contribute to our understanding of animal cognition and communication.

One of the investigations involves neuroscience studies. In general, scientists emphasize 5 elements which define animals’ consciousness (acc. to [faunalytics](https://faunalytics.org/inside-animal-minds-review/)):

+ **Emotions**: defined as a factor influencing our cognitive capacities related to judgment, learning, or memory, is not exclusive to humans. Many animals, including fish, exhibit indications of emotional changes that mirror our own experiences.
+ **Metacognition**: a concept encapsulating "thinking about thinking," is a subject of scientific inquiry concerning animals. Researchers investigate two facets of metacognition in animals: the capacity to assess one's own state of knowledge and the ability to recognize one's lack of knowledge, prompting the pursuit of additional information.
+ **Processing of past and future**: The ability to remember the past and plan for the future.Specific experiments have demonstrated these capabilities in primates, weasels, and corvids (crows and ravens).
+ **Social behavior**: refers to how animals engage with one another in groups, involves social cognition. This includes the ability to infer the knowledge, emotions, and intentions of other group members, crucial for building and sustaining relationships. These capacities rely on intricate cognitive processes that are likely interconnected with consciousness.
+ **Human-animal relationships**: Encompasses the ability of some animals to adjust their behavior when interacting with humans. For example, dogs will act differently towards humans than they do towards other dogs and are capable of recognizing distinct human individuals.


On top of that, the scientists have examined particular neurobiological structures that refer to counsciousness, such as the forebrain found in numerous mammals. Although this structure has not been identified in birds and fish, equivalent structures seem to be present in these species. Hence, neurobiology can help us in  serving as a valuable indicator suggesting the potential for consciousness in non-human species.
