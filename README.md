    <h2>What is my blog about?</h2>
      Oh, these lovely creatures (but sometimes the naughty ones). Why do we, humans, love them so much? Well, it’s all about our psychology. Pets create perfect companionship for humans
      throughout life. The bond between animals and humans is unbelievably strong, leading us to feelings of joy, comfort, and happiness. They make us feel meaningful, as we are the whole world
      for them. They are loyal and loving and are not afraid of showing unconditional affection to us. Mostly, they behave like children, and that’s why we love taking care of them. <br><hr> In my blog, I’ll consider several intriguing and informative topics about animals, as well as share my private dramatic history with you. After reading my posts, you’ll finally
      understand why I chose to present this particular topic.
