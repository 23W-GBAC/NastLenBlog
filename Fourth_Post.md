<h2>As we already discussed earlier, there are several different possibilities for developing cancer in animals. Why some creatures of the same breed get cancer while others don’t is still a big question. Nevertheless, we should look at some measures which can be helpful to try to stop cancer forever.</h2>

If we are responsible for those we have tamed, it’s in our hands to become sure what options are available to protect our animals from possible oncological diseases and help them live a long and happy life with us. When we refer to the [article by “Morris Animal Foundation”](https://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/article/tips-keep-your-pet-healthy-and-actions-you-can-take-stop-cancer-furever#:~:text=Avoid%20long%2Dterm%20exposure%20to,it%20is%20strongest%2C%20around%20midday.), it will suggest us several essential tips:

1. **Avoid Secondhand Smoke**: It’s vital to keep your home a smoke-free zone since the evidence shows that there’s a higher probability of developing cancer in animals who are exposed to environmental tobacco.

2. **Watch your Pet’s Weight**: Keeping your pet at a healthy weight is vital. Being overweighed is linked to a higher chance of cancer. Make sure your pet gets good food, and avoid feeding them an imbalanced diet.

Know Your Pet's Breed: Different dog and cat breeds can be prone to specific diseases, including cancer. Let’s look into the most suspectable breeds to cancer in dogs [Veterinary Referral Associates](https://www.vravet.com/site/blog/2022/03/31/which-dog-breeds-are-prone-to-developing-cancer):

+ *Golden Retrievers* <img width="150" alt="gifka" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/sjmetO8yUKb4c/giphy.gif">: Face a higher risk of cancer, particularly aggressive types like lymphoma and hemangiosarcoma (cancer of the blood vessels). 
+ *German Shepherds* <img width="70" alt="gifka" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hpRhtwCmOolbMEgoQk/giphy.gif">: admired by dog enthusiasts and trainers for their intelligence and loyalty, unfortunately, have a heightened susceptibility to cancer, particularly hemangiosarcoma (cancer of the blood vessels).

+ *Beagles* <img width="70" alt="gifka" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fcBkaFZ5y2p1K/giphy.gif">:  prone to recurrent urinary tract infections and have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer, especially if exposed frequently to lawn chemicals like pesticides and herbicides.

+ *Bernese Mountain Dogs* <img width="70" alt="gifka" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/cIWnCzlygezrdLl1P3/giphy.gif">: have a shorter lifespan and a higher risk of various cancers, including mast cell tumors and malignant histiocytosis (histiocytic sarcomas).
+ *Rottweilers* <img width="70" alt="gifka" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Im2DL7FSx7LXy/giphy.gif">: face an above-average risk of various cancers, such as soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), lymphoma, mast cell tumors, transitional cell carcinomas (bladder cancer), and hemangiosarcomas (cancer of the blood vessels).
+ *Boxers* <img width="70" alt="gifka" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0ExoOpQYXRtBsqxa/giphy.gif">, loyal and affectionate family dogs, often grapple with mast cell tumors, slow-growing cancer commonly found on the skin.

+ *Great Danes* <img width="70" alt="gifka" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LjXVOmTvaWj8GWkfy8/giphy.gif">, characterized by their well-mannered nature and graceful appearance, make excellent family companions but have a relatively shorter lifespan of 7 to 10 years. Consequently, they are prone to various health conditions, including cancer, cardiomyopathy, and gastric torsion.


3. **Regular Vet Checkups**: Just like people need regular checkups, so do pets. Yearly vet checkups help identify any health issues early on. It's crucial for a complete physical examination.

4. **Sunlight Exposure**: Similar to people, pets with light skin can be more prone to certain cancers. Protect your pet from the sun, especially around midday when it's strongest.

5. **Avoid Asbestos**: Asbestos exposure can be harmful to pets, similar to humans. If you're removing asbestos from your home, keep your pets away during the process.

6. **Include Vegetables in Their Diet**: Some studies suggest that adding vegetables to your pet's diet may reduce the risk of cancer. [Veterinary Referral](https://www.vravet.com/site/blog/2022/03/31/which-dog-breeds-are-prone-to-developing-cancer) Spinach, kale, and chard can all provide a number of benefits, but give them in moderation as some dogs experience upset stomach as a result of overconsuming. These vegetables all contain isothiocyanate, which lowers the risk of cancer. An additional benefit of this is that they help the body absorb the vitamins needed, and contain chlorophyll which can block a number of carcinogens.

7. **Monthly Pet Check**: Regularly examine your pet's mouth, ears, and body. Early detection is key for treating diseases, including cancer.

8. **Stay Away from Lawn Chemicals**: Try to keep your pet away from lawn products, as there's evidence suggesting a higher cancer risk with exposure to certain chemicals. [A 1991 study](https://www.humanesociety.org/news/dogs-lawn-care-and-cancer#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAlthough%20there%20are%20still%20a,sake%20of%20their%20pets%20and) found that dogs whose owners used herbicide 2,4-D were up to 200% more likely to develop lymphoma, and despite a follow-up study with ties to the chemical industry refuting the claim, a 2012 study confirmed an increased risk. According to a 2013 study, Scottish terriers exposed to herbicide-treated lawns had a greater risk of cancer—up to seven times higher. Trepanier is currently comparing chemical exposures in dogs with and without cancer in three ongoing studies. (Boxers are especially needed—email Lauren Trepanier to learn more.)

9. **Regular Exercise**: Keep your pet active. Regular exercise helps keep them mentally stimulated, and in good shape, and lowers the risk of health problems - e.g. Swimming, dog park, obedience training sessions, dog puzzles, etc.

10. **Avoid Paints and Solvents**: Some studies hint at a possible link between exposure to paints and solvents and cancer. Keep your pets away when using such substances.

11. **Know Your Pet Well**: Pay attention to your pet's behavior. Changes in routine or demeanor could be early signs of illness. Learn about their habits and preferences to notice any unusual signs.
