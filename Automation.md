## How I automated my blog 📝→🏎️
### Generator of Entertaining Facts about Animals
While I was writing my first post about [*human interaction with animals*](https://github.com/23W-GBAC/NastLenBlog/blob/main/First_Post.md) , I thought about one thing: if I like this topic so much that I've chosen it for my Blog, why not add some educational facts about animals? What if they will always be different?

That's how the idea of auto-generator of interesting facts has come to my mind. Here I'm gonna show you how I implemented this.


Goals I've set:
    - [ ] Find a suitable website containing facts about animals
    - [ ] Read the necessary data from this site
    - [ ] Organize the facts in a form of un (unordered list)
    - [ ] Insert one random fact into each post (starting from the second one)
